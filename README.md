# SCT_DS_4
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Data Preparation
First, loaded and preprocessed the data. This includes cleaning up missing values, converting columns as necessary, and simplifying categories if required.

# Correlation Analysis
Since many columns are categorical, we can either encode them or look at pairwise relationships using visualizations.
For correlation analysis, weâ€™ll convert categories to numerical labels.

# Categorical Analysis
Explore the relationship between accident severity and different factors like weather conditions, road surface type, and light conditions.

# Multivariate Analysis
Check for relationships between accident severity, weather conditions, light conditions, and cause of accidents.
